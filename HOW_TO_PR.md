# üõ†Ô∏è How to Submit a Pull Request (PR)

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step: PR Workflow

---

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

Start by forking the onboarding repo to your own GitHub account.

1. Go to:  
   https://github.com/GoogleSearch-Intern/google-search--onboarding

2. Click the **"Fork"** button (top-right)

3. Then clone your forked repo to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/google-search--onboarding.git
cd google-search--onboarding


 2. Create a New Branch for Your Task
For each task, use a new branch. Name it clearly:

git checkout -b arya/dayX-taskname

‚úÖ One task = one branch



3. Make Your Changes
Edit or add the files needed for your task:

Add content to arya_intro.md
Fix tools/search_tool.cpp
Create files in the docs/ folder



4. Stage and Commit Your Work
After saving your changes:

git add .
git commit -m "feat: completed Day 3 bugfix"

Commit message format tips:

feat: ‚Äì new feature or task
fix: ‚Äì bug fixes or corrections
docs: ‚Äì writing or updating documentation



5. Push Your Branch to GitHub
Push the branch to your fork:
git push origin arya/dayX-taskname


6. Open a Pull Request (PR)
Go to your fork on GitHub
(e.g., https://github.com/arya-user/google-search--onboarding)
GitHub will show a ‚ÄúCompare & pull request‚Äù button ‚Äî click it
On the PR page:
Base repo: GoogleSearch-Intern/google-search--onboarding
Base branch: main
Compare branch: your branch (e.g., arya/day3-bugfix)
Add a descriptive title:
feat: complete Day 3 bugfix and add bugfix_log.md




7. Assign Sakshi as Your Reviewer
On the right-hand side of the PR page:

Under Assignees, select @sakshijain
This will notify Sakshi to review your work.




8. Make Edits if Requested
If Sakshi asks for changes:

Edit the same files locally
Add and commit again:
git add .
git commit -m "fix: addressed review feedback"
git push origin arya/dayX-taskname

‚úÖ Your pull request will automatically update. No need to open a new one.







Best Practices

Always create a new branch for each task
One PR per task keeps things clean
Ask for help early if you're stuck
Keep PRs simple, small, and well-labeled
Keep your Chat thread active and async!
